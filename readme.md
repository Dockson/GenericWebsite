### To add the pictures ###
1. git clone git@github.com:Dockson/GenericWebsite.git
2. Take the pictures and add them to newly created GenericWebsite directory
    - better yet, make a new directory inside GenericWebsite called "Storyboards" or "Images"
    - You make a new directory with "mkdir name_of_new_directory"
3. git add --all 
    - or: git add name_of_picture
    - if you made a new directory, do: git add name_of_dir/name_of_pic
    - remember you can use "git status" to see what's going on
4. git commit -m "Adding storyboard pictures"
5. git pull origin master
6. git push origin master

-- and that is the essential workflow
